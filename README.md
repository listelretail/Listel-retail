Listel – Local Shopping Lists for Physical Retail

Overview

Listel is an idea and concept for turning generic shopping lists into store-specific, local shopping experiences.

Today, most shopping lists are digital but store-agnostic.
They don’t reflect the real layout of a store, seasonal shelves, or local actions.
As a result, customers walk inefficiently, miss promotions, and stores lose potential revenue.

Listel proposes a neutral layer between shopping preparation and in-store execution.

The Problem

In physical retail today:
	•	Shopping decisions are made before entering the store
	•	Shopping lists are:
	•	not ordered by real store layout
	•	blind to seasonal or temporary shelves
	•	Local store managers:
	•	have little or no access to digital customer channels
	•	are dependent on flyers and posters
	•	Central retail apps focus on:
	•	brand campaigns
	•	global promotions
not on local store reality

There is no digital tool that reflects how a specific store actually works.

⸻

The Idea

Listel extends the shopping list into a local, store-specific experience.

Before shopping
	•	Customers select a specific store
	•	The shopping list is:
	•	reordered to the real walking path of that store
	•	enriched with seasonal shelves and local actions
	•	Purchase decisions are made consciously at home, not under time pressure

During shopping
	•	A dedicated “list mode” allows:
	•	checking off items
	•	marking products as found / not found
	•	Optional light gamification:
	•	points
	•	personal or store-related highscores
	•	Especially helpful for families and weekly shopping

⸻

Value for Stores

Listel is designed as a neutral tool for local stores, not an advertising platform.

Potential benefits:
	•	Increased basket size (early assumptions: ~5%)
	•	Higher customer return rate
	•	Better visibility of seasonal and additional shelves
	•	First-party insights into:
	•	what customers search for
	•	what they don’t find
	•	where friction happens in the store

No brand substitution.
No product advertising.
Focus on store efficiency and customer experience.

Why Neutrality Matters

Most existing solutions monetize attention through advertising:
	•	branded product placement
	•	sponsored substitutions
	•	paid visibility

Listel intentionally avoids this.

The core principle:

Help customers shop better and help stores perform better – without influencing brand choice.

This neutrality is essential for trust on both sides.

⸻

Target Users
	•	Physical retail stores with:
	•	high weekly shopping volume
	•	families as a core customer group
	•	Store managers with local responsibility
	•	Retail formats with seasonal or temporary shelves

The idea explicitly starts bottom-up, at store level.

⸻

Long-Term Vision
	•	The shopping list becomes the entry point
	•	Local usage creates a new data layer:
	•	real shopping behavior
	•	store-specific friction points
	•	Over time, this enables:
	•	better store layouts
	•	assortment optimization
	•	data-informed local retail decisions

⸻

Current Status
	•	Concept & business logic defined
	•	Early validation planned via direct outreach to store managers
	•	This repository is idea-first, not a finished product

⸻

Why This Is on GitHub

This project is published openly to:
	•	document the idea transparently
	•	invite discussion and feedback
	•	explore technical, UX, or business perspectives
	•	keep early thinking public and evolvable

It is not a commitment to a specific implementation.

⸻

Contributions & Feedback

Feedback, questions, and alternative perspectives are welcome.

Possible contribution areas:
	•	UX flows for store-specific lists
	•	data models for store layouts
	•	privacy-first analytics concepts
	•	integration ideas with existing retail systems
